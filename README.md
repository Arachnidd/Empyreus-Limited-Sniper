#OUTDATED CODE! OUTDATED API's! If you wish to comission another sniper (fastest guarenteed) dm @spiderphobias on discord!

# Empyreus-Roblox-Limited-Sniper
Empyreus was the #1 sniper for a short period until I had school work and totally gave up on roblox. I've decided to open source the bot since no good offers came in which I was hoping for. Don't contact me for support on this, im over with Roblox.

There may be bugs, this isnt the original, i editted it to remove the discord bot and make a bit neater so yeah there may be bugs. If there is a simple bug just contact me, but if its regarding getting proxies or help with the bot, dont expect help.

How was Empyreus so fast Proxied? It's simple! We host proxies, and we have a whopping 8,192 IPS right inside Ashburn with 0.4ms ping from Roblox. We also have multiple locations, want to learn more? Join: https://discord.gg/4A9SRR2y8E our proxies for affordable and amazing speeds!

# Requirements
1 - Don't overwhelm your pc. Use only the threads your pc can handle. Too many can kill your internet and pc.
2 - Proxies. Many suspected us to be proxyless, a part of us was, but I wont be releasing that part as its simply too overwhelming to Roblox. I reccomend using blitzproxies (https://discord.gg/4A9SRR2y8E) proxies are hosted right in Ashburn and gives the fastest speeds possible.
3 - Cookies. For list sniper, cookies are required. I was using roughly 10,000, but you can use less.
4 - A dedicated server. My specs were 64GB RAM, 30 threads.

# How To Start

1 - Install & setup nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download

2 - Run `npm install pm2 -g` in your console (open console, search it on your computer, on windows you can search it by pressing the windows key and search "console")

3 - Download this github and extract the files

4 - Open up config.json once extracted. This is where all the info goes. **ALL INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT ISNT!** Always Remember to save before you close!

5 - Once config file is setup, open up console in the file directory your in. You can easily do this by doing `cd yourfiledirectoryhere` or press the bar right beside the search bar in your files/folder and write cmd, thatll automatically open up the current directory. In the directory you want to write `npm i`

6 - After the `npm i` command is done downloading everything, you can run the projected detector. It isn't perfect, but itll do. It is in the iteminfo folder named `itemvaluer.js`. To start it up, do `node itemvaluer.js`. Itll then start valuing items. It is on an infinite loop, it will never stop, so once you think there is enough items valued you can close the console to stop it. Typically a good 2-3 hours it perfect.

7 - After running the projected detector, and you want to start the actual sniper, run `pm2 start index.js`.

8 - Enjoy ;)

# Apis im using:
`https://catalog.roblox.com/v2/search/items/details?Category=1&MinPrice=${minprice}&MaxPrice=${maxprice}&limit=120&CreatorName=ROBLOX&salesTypeFilter=2&cursor=`

`https://catalog.roblox.com/v1/search/items/details?Category=1&MinPrice=${minprice}&MaxPrice=${maxprice}&limit=30&CreatorName=ROBLOX&salesTypeFilter=2&cursor=` <-- I didn't use this, but it is pretty good.

`https://economy.roblox.com/v1/assets/${itemID}/resellers`

`https://economy.roblox.com/v1/purchases/products/${productID}`

`https://catalog.roblox.com/v1/catalog/items/details` <-- This API has a vulnerability, i have not used this api in this code just because its simply too overpowered. If you find the vulnerability, don't abuse it, Roblox will not like it. It essentially will make it unratelimitted which is really abusive, think of how you'd like it if you were in Roblox's place. I've reported the vulnerability to Roblox, but they simply do not care.
